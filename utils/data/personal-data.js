  description: "I'm Victor Chogo, a full-stack developer with 5+ years of experience building secure, scalable, and impact driven digital solutions. I specialize in the MERN stack, Flutter, Laravel, cloud platforms (AWS, GCP), and cybersecurity best practices, delivering custom web applications for nonprofits, startups, and mission focused organizations. My recent work includes integrating AI assisted features like recommendation engines, smart search, and automated workflows into client platforms enhancing user experience, personalization, and operational efficiency. I’m also deeply aligned with the principles of vibe coding: blending system thinking, AI toolchains, clean architecture, and intuitive user flows to deliver not just code, but cohesive and emotionally resonant digital experiences. Whether it’s building APIs, deploying secure cloud solutions, or crafting AI-enhanced interfaces, I bring creativity, structure, and purpose to every line of code.",
